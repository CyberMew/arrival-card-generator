Basically this tries to be the standalone version of https://www.singlewindow.sh.cn/hj/arrval, because that submits your data to their backend which might seems suspicious, and it is unknown to me if this is a legit site or not.


# Arrival Card QR Decoder & Editor

This project is a web-based tool for decoding, editing, and generating QR codes for arrival card information. It allows users to input encrypted Base64 strings, decode them into a form, edit the data, and re-encode it into a QR code.

## Features

- **Decode Base64 Strings**: Users can paste an encrypted Base64 string to decode and populate the form fields.
- **Edit Form Data**: The form allows users to edit personal, travel, and contact information.
- **Generate QR Code**: After editing, the data can be re-encoded into a Base64 string and displayed as a QR code.
- **Multi-language Support**: The form supports multiple languages, including English, Japanese, Korean, Russian, French, and Spanish.
- **Dynamic Field Visibility**: Certain fields, such as Visa Number, are dynamically shown or hidden based on user input.
- **Validation**: The form includes validation for required fields and proper formatting.
- **No Data Submission**: All operations are performed locally in the browser. No data is sent to any server, ensuring privacy and security.
